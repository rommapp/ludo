#
# A single play session usually produces BOTH a save and a save state for one
# game, and they arrive seconds apart down different paths: the state through
# process_save_upload, the save through the session-sync summary. Toasting each
# as it lands gives two notifications for what the user experienced as one
# event. So hold them briefly and emit one merged toast per game.
#
# The activity feed is deliberately NOT merged — each path files its own row, so
# the log keeps the detail ("State uploaded", "Save sync — …, 1 save uploaded")
# while the toast stays glanceable.
#
# The window is a debounce: each new event for a game restarts it, so a save and
# a state from one action merge even when they arrive apart. _TOAST_COALESCE_MAX
# caps the total hold so a steady drip of events can't postpone it forever.
#
# 3s is measured, not guessed. Across 189 toast-worthy events the save/state gap
# is bimodal: pairs from a single action land 0.21–0.54s apart, and the next gap
# up is 9.35s — those wider ones are separate saves made during a session, which
# SHOULD toast separately. 3s sits in the empty band between the two clusters:
# ~6x headroom over the widest real pair, with no risk of welding two distinct

# ─── RomM slug → ES-DE / RetroDECK ROM folder ────────────────────────────────
# RomM names platform folders with IGDB slugs; ES-DE (and therefore RetroDECK)
# scans a fixed set of folder names of its own, and the two disagree for a good
# number of systems — most famously Dreamcast, where RomM says 'dc' and ES-DE
# wants 'dreamcast'. Downloading into the RomM slug leaves the games invisible
# to RetroDECK's library even though the files are perfectly fine.
#
# Only the disagreements are listed; a slug absent from this map is already an
# ES-DE folder name (69 of the slugs Ludo knows are). Entries were derived by
# diffing RomM's UniversalPlatformSlug enum against ES-DE's es_systems.xml
# <name> values, and cover the systems a RetroArch core or standalone emulator
# can actually run — pure metadata platforms (Stadia, iOS, VR headsets) have no
# ES-DE folder to map to and are deliberately left alone.

# Rows per /api/roms request during a full library fetch. RomM charges a fixed
# ~1.15s per request plus ~3.5ms per row, so small pages are overhead-dominated:
# measured on a 3,083-ROM instance, limit=100 costs 15ms/row and limit=1000 costs
# 4.8ms/row. Exported because a resume checkpoint is only valid for the page size
# that produced it — see main.py's _resume_begin.
#
# That per-row figure is why this was 1000, and it is why 1000 was wrong.
#
# Response time is not linear in page size: it is flat until the response
# reaches ~5MB and then falls off a cliff. Measured against a 16.5k-ROM RomM
# 5.1.1-beta.1 instance, offset 0, medians of repeated samples:
#
#     limit=250  3.3MB   2.06s        limit=400  6.1MB  23.39s
#     limit=300  4.3MB   2.16s        limit=450  7.1MB  21.78s
#     limit=350  5.2MB   2.49s        limit=500  8.1MB  31.50s
#
# 14% more rows for 10x the time, tracking response SIZE rather than row count —
# the signature of a buffering threshold (nginx spilling to a temp file, or the
# body being buffered whole) rather than query cost. The old 1000-row page is
# ~16MB here, three times past the cliff, and took over 90s: past our own read
# timeout, so the client hung up (logged as a 499) while RomM went on building a
# response nobody would read and the retry below queued a second one.
#
# 100 rows is ~1.3MB, a 4-5x margin under the cliff. The margin is the point:
# rows are 13-16KB on that instance but /api/roms has no row projection in RomM
# 5.1.1 (`fields` is not a parameter — see ROM_TRIM_FIELDS), so every row carries
# all 73 columns including metadata blobs, and a library with richer metadata has
# fatter rows that hit the ceiling at fewer of them. Sizing to the measured cliff
# would leave those instances broken. This also matches argosy-launcher, the
# RomM-org Android client, which pages at 100.
#
# Deep offsets were investigated and are NOT a factor: limit=100 costs 1.07s at
# offset 0 and 1.69s at offset 4000. An earlier run showing 20s+ at depth was
# measuring contention from an unrelated stuck query, not offset cost.

# one of them looked reasonable when written. What they had in common is that
# nobody was counting bytes: the numbers were chosen as row counts, and the

    not — one probe that happened to come back was enough to declare the server
    reachable, announce "Back online" to the user, and kick a save-sync flush
    that then died on DNS. On a handheld that is genuinely offline that is not a
    rare race: the probe loop runs every 25s forever, so a single misleading
    answer (a captive portal, a stale proxy, a router that ACKs then drops) is
    reached eventually, and the user gets nagged on a loop. See
    Covin90/romm-retroarch-sync#23.

    So the rule here is symmetry: an edge in EITHER direction needs more than
    one sample.

    - offline needs ``FAILS_TO_OFFLINE`` consecutive failures. A probe competes
      with whatever else is using the link (a download saturating it will time
      one out), so an isolated miss says nothing.
    - the offline→online edge needs ``OKS_TO_RECONNECT`` consecutive successes,
      unless the caller passes ``confirmed=True`` for evidence stronger than a
      probe (the OS reporting the network came back, *and* a real API call
      succeeding on the back of it).

    Only that one edge is debounced. Coming up from "never determined" (startup)
    still takes a single success — a fresh connect must report online at once or
    the UI sits in a fictitious offline state for the length of the debounce.

    The latch also owns ``device_online`` (what the OS last told us about the
    link). Note that a probe success no longer overwrites it unconditionally:
    doing so let one flaky answer erase an authoritative "there is no network",
    after which nothing put it back, because the event that would have — the

        rewrites the file, we read ITS value (still correct, just less capable)

        Saves only. States are left alone — they are ROM-named, so they match

        21-save inventory against a 16,541-game library re-derived roughly
        350,000 name comparisons — measured at 2.3s of the ~3s a player waits

        Cached against the games list by IDENTITY, holding a reference to it.
        A refreshed library is a new list object, which drops the whole cache;
        keeping the reference is what makes that test sound, since comparing
        id() alone can be fooled by a freed list's address being reused.

        Negative results are cached too — "no match" costs a full six-tier walk

        its revision ("Crazy Taxi 2 v1.004 (2001)(Sega)(US)[!].state" inside
        "Crazy Taxi 2 (2001)(Sega)(US)[!]/"). Matching on the ROM stem found
        nothing, so Continue playing launched such a game at the title screen
        and showed box art instead of the state's screenshot.
