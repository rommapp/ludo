# update or a DLC where the base game belongs — "Mario Party Superstars
# [01006FE013472800]" is a patch, and the base game it hid had no tile at all.

# walked when its rom_count moves; a library that is merely mis-grouped keeps
# its count forever, so nothing would ever heal it. Hence a bump rather than a

        games silently disappear from the library the moment they flip a switch,

        Pure: it reads the four maps it is given and returns two lists, so the

        matters more here than it looks — this is the function that decides
        whether a library that has silently drifted ever gets noticed, and its

            everything already in it.
          * Count moved → walk. This is the cheap signal and it stays first.
          * Explicitly demanded (``only_platform``/``force_platforms``) → walk.
          * Count matched, but the newest ROM timestamp moved → walk. Counts
            report a NET, so a delete plus an add of equal size is invisible to
            them; this is the case that let a re-added ROM linger as a dead
            entry for as long as nobody else touched the platform.
          * Count matched, no mark known yet → adopt the mark, do not walk. The
            alternative is re-walking every platform once the first time this
            runs, which on a large library costs minutes to learn nothing.
          * Count matched, mark unreadable → do nothing, adopt nothing. An
            unanswered probe is not a match, and stamping it would make the
            next comparison agree with a value never read.

        /api/platforms carries every platform's `rom_count` for free, so one
        cheap call says which platforms changed size since we last walked them.
        Those are re-walked; the rest are left alone. The set difference within
        a re-walked platform is what was added and what was deleted — no
        arithmetic, so nothing has to correct for sibling grouping, and adds and
        deletes fall out of the same pass. (argosy-launcher reconciles the same
        way, by set difference per platform, though it re-walks unconditionally
        because it keeps no watermark at all.)

        Compares server-against-server: today's rom_count against the count
        recorded when we last walked that platform. A local entry count would be
        meaningless here — grouping makes it smaller than the server's by an
        amount only a walk can know.

        `force_platforms` is a set of platform ids to walk whatever their count
        says. It closes the one blind spot counts have: an add and a delete of
        equal size inside one platform leaves rom_count untouched and is
        invisible here. But such a change contains an add by definition, and
        `updated_after` returns that added row — so the caller already holds
        proof the platform moved and passes the id in. See its use in
        `refresh_from_romm` for why only genuinely-new ids qualify.

        Returns a stats dict. `checked` is None when the platform list was
