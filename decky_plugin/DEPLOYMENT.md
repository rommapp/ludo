# Decky Plugin Deployment Guide

> **For AI agents and developers:** This file documents the complete build and packaging process
> for the Ludo Decky plugin. Read this before making any changes to the build process.

---

## Overview

The plugin has two components:
- **Frontend** — TypeScript/React in `src/index.tsx`, compiled to `dist/index.js` via rollup
- **Backend** — `py_modules/ludo_app/` (the shared `LudoBackend`) on top of
  `py_modules/romm_sync_engine/`. `main.py` is only Decky's entry point: it does the
  Deck-specific bootstrap, describes this deployment as a `HostProfile`, and subclasses
  `LudoBackend` as `Plugin` because that is the name Decky Loader looks for.

`py_modules/sync_core.py` is a **dev symlink** to `../../src/sync_core.py`. It is resolved to a
real file during packaging. Never commit the resolved copy — the symlink is intentional.
`pnpm run package` builds the frontend and a `postpackage` hook **restores the symlink** afterward,
so the working tree is always left clean.

---

## Loose deploy (dev iteration loop)

When the dev machine **is** the Steam/Decky machine, the fastest loop is to overwrite the
installed plugin's files in place — no zip, no reinstall, no `sudo` (the install dir is
user-writable). The plugin lives at:

```
~/homebrew/plugins/ludo/
```

After editing source, copy only what changed, then reload the plugin from the Decky QAM
(or toggle it off/on):

```bash
cd /path/to/ludo
DEST=~/homebrew/plugins/ludo

# Frontend change (src/index.tsx):
(cd decky_plugin && pnpm run build) && cp decky_plugin/dist/index.js decky_plugin/dist/index.js.map "$DEST/dist/"

# Backend change (app/ludo_app/*.py — the shared backend):
cp app/ludo_app/*.py "$DEST/py_modules/ludo_app/"

# Decky entry point change (main.py — rare; bootstrap and HostProfile only):
cp decky_plugin/main.py "$DEST/main.py"

# Shared sync logic (src/sync_core.py) — DEST has a real copy, not a symlink:
cp src/sync_core.py "$DEST/py_modules/sync_core.py"
```

Notes:
- A **full plugin reload** is required for any Python change (`ludo_app/`, `main.py`,
  `sync_core.py`) — Python is only
  imported at load). Frontend (`dist/index.js`) also needs a reload to re-evaluate.
- Backend Python logs land in `~/homebrew/logs/ludo/<timestamp>.log`. Frontend
  `console.*`/toasts do **not**; bridge them to the backend with a temporary `debug_log`
  callable when diagnosing frontend issues.
- Loose deploy is for iteration only — always cut a real zip (below) for releases/handoff.

## Build & Package (release zip)

The recipe below is **cwd-independent** — it anchors everything to the repo root via `git`, so
it works whether you paste it from the repo root or from inside `decky_plugin/`. `pnpm run
package` builds the frontend and restores the `py_modules/sync_core.py` symlink via its
`postpackage` hook.

> ⚠️ Always run `pnpm run package` in a **subshell** `(cd decky_plugin && …)` — it leaves the
> shell in `decky_plugin/`, so a bare `cd decky_plugin && pnpm run package` breaks every
> repo-root-relative `cp` that follows.

```bash
# Anchor to the repo root no matter where this is pasted from.
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
cd "$ROOT"

# Step 1: Build frontend (auto-restores the symlink afterward). Subshell keeps cwd at ROOT.
(cd decky_plugin && pnpm run package)

# Step 2: Package into the versioned zip.
# VERSION is derived from decky_plugin/package.json (the single source of truth),
# not hardcoded — bump it there and the zip name follows automatically.
VERSION="$(node -p "require('./decky_plugin/package.json').version")"
PLUGIN_NAME="ludo"
PLUGIN_DIR="decky_plugin"
OUT_ZIP="Ludo-v${VERSION}-decky.zip"
TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
mkdir -p "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/dist" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/assets" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/bin"
cp "${PLUGIN_DIR}/plugin.json" "${PLUGIN_DIR}/package.json" "${PLUGIN_DIR}/LICENSE" "${PLUGIN_DIR}/main.py" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/"
cp "${PLUGIN_DIR}/dist/index.js" "${PLUGIN_DIR}/dist/index.js.map" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/dist/"
cp -rL "${PLUGIN_DIR}/py_modules" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/"
# The artwork is package data of ludo_app, so the `cp -rL py_modules` above
# already placed it at py_modules/ludo_app/assets/ — where the backend reads
# it. Only the plugin-list icon is copied to the plugin root.
cp "${PLUGIN_DIR}/py_modules/ludo_app/assets/logo.png" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/assets/"
cp "${PLUGIN_DIR}/bin/7zz" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/bin/" && chmod +x "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/bin/7zz"
cp "${PLUGIN_DIR}/bin/romm-session-host" "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/bin/" && chmod +x "${TMP_DIR}/${PLUGIN_NAME}/bin/romm-session-host"  # Steam session-host: the RomM tile's exe; execs the picked emulator as a Steam-tracked child so the overlay works on Deck Gaming Mode
(cd "$TMP_DIR" && zip -rq "$OUT_ZIP" "${PLUGIN_NAME}/")
mv "$TMP_DIR/$OUT_ZIP" .
rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"

# Step 3 (optional): sanity-check a fix is actually in the bundled sync_core
unzip -p "$OUT_ZIP" "${PLUGIN_NAME}/py_modules/sync_core.py" | grep -c "_host_subprocess_env"
```

The output zip is at the **repo root**: `Ludo-v<VERSION>-decky.zip` (~11 MB with
bundled libs), where `<VERSION>` comes from `decky_plugin/package.json`, which the zip name
follows automatically. Don't bump that version by hand to cut a release: it has to stay in
lockstep with `desktop/package.json` and the tag, so use `scripts/release.sh` (see
[RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md)). (The GTK app lives in the separate romm-retroarch-sync
repo and versions independently.)

## Publish a release

**Don't publish by hand — see [RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md).** Releases are cut by
pushing a tag; CI builds this zip *and* the desktop AppImage from that tag, refuses to
publish unless both are present, and sets the prerelease flag from the version string:

```bash
scripts/release.sh 1.0.0-beta.8
```

The manual `gh release create` flow this section used to describe is no longer correct.
It publishes a release carrying only the `-decky.zip`, which the desktop updater then
skips — and because `select_release` picks the semver *maximum*, that release also
outranks the last complete one, so desktop users see "no update available" instead of an
error. It also left the prerelease flag to be remembered by hand, which pushes a beta to
every stable user when it's forgotten.

The recipe above is still the right way to build a zip for **loose deploy, testing, or
handoff** — just don't attach the result to a GitHub release yourself.

**Why `cp -rL`?** `py_modules/sync_core.py` and `py_modules/bios_manager.py` are symlinks in
the dev tree. The `-L` flag dereferences all symlinks so real file content goes into the zip.
Without it, the zip contains broken symlinks and the plugin fails to load.

**Why `pnpm run package` and not `pnpm run build`?** `package` runs the build then a
`postpackage` hook that re-creates the `py_modules/sync_core.py` symlink, so the working tree
isn't left with a resolved copy. (Plain `build` also works but won't touch the symlink.)

## Required files in the ZIP

Decky Loader's installer validates all of these. **Any missing file causes silent installation failure.**

| File | Required | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| `plugin.json` | YES | Plugin metadata — see rules below |
| `package.json` | YES | Decky Loader validator requires it |
| `LICENSE` | YES | Decky Loader validator requires it |
| `main.py` | YES | Decky entry point: bootstrap + the `Plugin` subclass |
| `py_modules/ludo_app/` | YES | The backend itself (symlink in dev — must be real files in zip) |
| `dist/index.js` | YES | Compiled frontend |
| `dist/index.js.map` | YES | Source map |
| `py_modules/sync_core.py` | YES | Sync daemon logic (symlink in dev — must be real file in zip) |
| `py_modules/bios_manager.py` | YES | BIOS management logic (symlink in dev — must be real file in zip) |
| `py_modules/requests/` | YES | Bundled dependency (not on SteamOS) |
| `py_modules/watchdog/` | YES | Bundled dependency (not on SteamOS) |
| `py_modules/PIL/` | YES | Bundled dependency (Pillow for image processing) |
| `py_modules/pillow.libs/` | YES | Bundled shared libs for Pillow C extensions |
| `py_modules/qrcode/` | YES | Bundled dependency (QR encoding for device pairing) |
| `py_modules/urllib3/`, `certifi/`, `charset_normalizer/`, `idna/` | YES | Transitive deps of requests |
| `assets/logo.png` | NO | Plugin icon shown in Decky's plugin list (the copy the backend serves is `py_modules/ludo_app/assets/logo.png`) |
| `assets/romm-isotipo.svg` | NO | RomM brand mark shown on the setup-wizard welcome; served pre-connection by `get_romm_logo` (bundled because RomM server assets need auth) |
| `assets/romm-{grid,hero,logo,header,icon}.png` | NO | RomM-branded Steam library artwork for the optional 'RomM' launcher tile (Steam asset types 0/1/2/3/4). Served by `get_romm_artwork`, painted via `SetCustomArtworkForApp`. Regenerate with `scripts/gen_romm_artwork.py` (needs cairosvg; dev-only). |
| `bin/7zz` | NO | Static 7-Zip (x64) for `.7z` extraction — SteamOS has no system 7z. `sync_core._find_7z()` resolves `<plugin>/bin/7zz`. Must be `chmod +x`. Without it: `.7z` console ROMs still load via RetroArch, `.7z` PC games won't auto-extract. |
| `bin/romm-session-host` | NO | Exe behind the "RomM" Steam tile. When a game is picked, the backend `prepare_steam_launch` writes a launch-spec and the frontend RunGame's the tile; Steam launches this script as a tracked game (opening the overlay session) and it `exec`s the resolved emulator argv in-place, so the emulator inherits the Steam overlay on Deck Gaming Mode. Returned by `get_session_host_path`. Must be `chmod +x`. Without it: Play falls back to a direct daemon launch (no working overlay). |

### ZIP structure

The zip must have a **single top-level directory** named `ludo/`:

```
ludo/
  plugin.json
  package.json
  LICENSE
  main.py
  dist/
    index.js
    index.js.map
  py_modules/
    sync_core.py        ← real file (symlink dereferenced by cp -rL)
    bios_manager.py     ← real file (symlink dereferenced by cp -rL)
    requests/
    watchdog/
    PIL/
    qrcode/
    pillow.libs/
    urllib3/
    certifi/
    charset_normalizer/
    idna/
  assets/
    logo.png
    romm-isotipo.svg
```

---

## plugin.json rules

- `"flags"` **must be `[]`** — setting `["_root"]` silently blocks ZIP installation in Decky Loader
- `"api_version"` must be `2`
- `"name"` is the display name shown in Decky ("Ludo")

---

## Installation on SteamOS

1. Transfer the ZIP file (e.g., `Ludo-v1.0.0-decky.zip`) to the SteamOS device
2. In Decky Loader: **gear icon → "Install plugin from ZIP"**
3. Select the zip file

Do **not** restart Decky Loader after installation — use the Decky QAM reload button if needed.

### Optional: Send to Steam Deck via SSH

If `sshpass` is installed and the Deck is reachable, you can send the zip directly:

```bash
sshpass -p "<password>" scp Ludo-v1.0.0-decky.zip deck@<deck-ip>:~/
```

Then install from `~/Ludo-v1.0.0-decky.zip` on the Deck via Decky Loader.

---

## Prerequisites

- `pnpm` must be available (`which pnpm`)
- `node` ≥ 18
- `zip` utility

---

## Known gotchas

- `zip --prefix` is not supported on this system — the packaging command uses a temp dir instead
- The `_root` flag in `plugin.json` silently blocks ZIP installation (no error shown in UI)
- `package.json` and `LICENSE` are not used at runtime but are required by the Decky validator
- The symlinks at `py_modules/sync_core.py` and `py_modules/bios_manager.py` must not be
  committed as regular files — use `cp -rL` when packaging to dereference them. Using `cp -r`
  alone copies symlinks as-is, which become broken inside the zip (no error at zip time, but
  the plugin fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` at load time)
- Missing `py_modules/requests/` (and other bundled libs) causes `No module named 'requests'`
  on a fresh Decky install — always copy the entire `py_modules/` directory, not just
  `sync_core.py`
- **Decky Loader's Python is 3.11** (AppImage bundles its own interpreter at `/tmp/_MEI*/`). Pillow and any other bundled wheels with C extensions **must be compiled for Python 3.11**, not the SteamOS system Python (3.13). To refresh `py_modules/PIL/` and `py_modules/pillow.libs/`:
  ```bash
  pip download Pillow --python-version 3.11 --platform manylinux_2_28_x86_64 --only-binary :all: -d /tmp/pillow-311/
  cd /tmp/pillow-311 && unzip -q pillow-*.whl -d extracted/
  rm -rf decky_plugin/py_modules/PIL decky_plugin/py_modules/pillow.libs decky_plugin/py_modules/pillow-*.dist-info
  cp -r extracted/PIL decky_plugin/py_modules/PIL
  cp -r extracted/pillow.libs decky_plugin/py_modules/pillow.libs
  cp -r extracted/pillow-*.dist-info decky_plugin/py_modules/
  ```
