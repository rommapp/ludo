# Assemble everything the packaged desktop app needs at runtime.
#
# The AppImage has no venv and no source tree, so the Python side has to ship
# with it: a standalone interpreter, the engine, and the backend's deps. This
# script builds two directories that electron-builder copies into resources/:
#
#   runtime/python/   a relocatable CPython with all deps installed
#   runtime/app-src/  a mirror of the repo layout the backend expects
#
# The mirror matters: backend/server.py resolves REPO_ROOT as parents[2] and
# reads decky_plugin/ next to desktop/. Reproducing that shape keeps the
# packaged and source layouts identical, so there is no packaged-only path
# branch in the Python to get wrong.
#
# Idempotent: re-running reuses the downloaded interpreter unless FORCE=1.
