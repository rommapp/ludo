// Replaces the GTK3/WebKit2GTK shell (desktop/app.py). Same lifecycle: spawn the

// load a BrowserWindow at it, and stop the backend cleanly on window close — no
// background daemon. See desktop/README.md for the architecture.
//
// Differences from app.py, on purpose:
//   • Gamepad input uses Chromium's native Gamepad API (see preload.js), not the
//     libmanette bridge — that native workaround existed only for a WebKitGTK
//     Bluetooth-pad bug that Chromium doesn't share.
//   • No __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC: that's a WebKitGTK/NVIDIA-Wayland bug and
//     doesn't apply to Electron's Chromium renderer.

// The name Electron reports for itself — window titles it derives, the shell's

// electron-builder writes only `name` there ("ludo-desktop"); `productName`,
// which is what we'd want, stays behind in the source manifest as build config.
// So without this the app introduces itself as "ludo-desktop".
//
// setName also moves userData (~/.config/<name>), which is where Chromium keeps
// this app's cookies and localStorage — renaming it would silently strand every
// existing install's stored UI state. Pin the path to what it resolved to before
// the rename so only the display name changes.

// ── GPU / compositing (Linux) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Chromium (and so Steam Big Picture, which is CEF) performs badly on Linux when
// its GPU process fails to initialize: it either drops to the software
// rasterizer or renders through XWayland, where a hardcoded 60Hz vsync path
// stutters. On a Wayland session we ask Ozone to run NATIVELY on Wayland
// (`auto` = Wayland when in a Wayland session, X11 otherwise), which restores
// GPU compositing and proper frame pacing instead of the XWayland fallback.
// Opt out with ROMM_OZONE=0 (or force a backend, e.g. ROMM_OZONE=x11) if a
// specific driver misbehaves.

  // A desktop's shell doesn't take the window's icon from BrowserWindow's `icon`
  // on Wayland — it identifies the window by its app_id (WM_CLASS on X11), looks
  // up the .desktop entry that claims that id, and draws *that* entry's Icon.
  // Chromium derives the id from the executable name, which electron-builder
  // takes from package.json's `name` ("ludo-desktop"), while the entry it
  // generates advertises StartupWMClass from `productName` ("Ludo"). Nothing
  // claims "ludo-desktop", so GNOME finds no entry and falls back to a generic
  // icon in the dock and Alt-Tab — even though the entry in the app grid, which
  // is read straight off the file, looks correct.
  //
  // Pin the id to the name the entry already advertises rather than the other
  // way round: exported entries are copies sitting in users' home directories
  // that we can't retroactively edit, so the shipped binary has to match them.

// localStorage/sessionStorage/IndexedDB are keyed by origin. Every launch
// therefore started with empty web storage, which silently defeated all the
// renderer's caches (the account-identity pill, platform icons, the browse
// lists): they wrote to a bucket nothing would ever read again.
//
// So the window loads `ludo://app/` instead, and this scheme proxies every
// request through to whatever port the backend actually got. The origin is now
// constant across launches, web storage persists, and the renderer needs no
// changes — its requests are all same-origin relative paths (/api/…).
