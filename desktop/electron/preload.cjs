// Renderer-side gamepad bridge for the Electron shell.
//
// The GTK shell reads the controller natively with libmanette because
// WebKitGTK's W3C Gamepad API mangles Xbox-compatible pads over Bluetooth (d-pad
// and triggers collapse onto stick axes). Chromium's Gamepad API does NOT have
// that bug, so here we poll navigator.getGamepads() directly and drive the same
// `window.__rommGamepad` API that src/host/gamepad.ts installs — no native
// module. If Chromium's mapping ever proves unreliable on some pad, this is the
// single place to swap in a node-hid/XInput fallback.
//
// Mapping cross-check — Chromium "standard" layout → GamepadButtonId, verified
// against the libmanette table in gamepad_bridge.py's docstring:
//

  //     arms that) while delivering no button state at all — measured, see
  //     native-input.cjs. The 8BitDo Ultimate goes further and enumerates TWO
  //     interfaces, at least one of which is permanently silent.
  //   * The kernel reader sees everything, but a multi-interface pad reports the
  //     same physical press on every one of its nodes.

  // to ANY pad, the kernel path was discarded for the rest of the session. That

  // the controller worked for the split second before the first press, then went
  // dead for good, and a power-cycled pad never came back.
