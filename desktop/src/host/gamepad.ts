// Gamepad → focus/navigation layer.
//
// On the Steam Deck, Steam reads the controller, moves focus between Focusable
// elements, and dispatches button events (onButtonDown/onCancelButton/…) into
// the focused subtree. The desktop app reproduces that here.
//
// Input does NOT come from the W3C Gamepad API: WebKitGTK's mapping for
// Xbox-compatible pads over Bluetooth is broken (d-pad and triggers collapse
// onto stick axes, indistinguishable). Instead the native shell reads the
// controller with libmanette (correct, named events) and calls the injection
// API this module installs on `window.__rommGamepad`:
//
//   • direction("up"|"down"|"left"|"right"|null) → spatial focus move + repeat
//   • button(id, pressed) → onButtonDown/onButtonUp routed up the Focusable
//     tree; A(OK) also activates (clicks) the focused control on release.
//
// Focusable (ui.tsx) registers its button handlers here so we can route to the
// focused subtree; focus *targets* are found by DOM query so native buttons and
// inputs participate too.
