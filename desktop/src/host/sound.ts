// desktop shell replaces that focus engine with its own (gamepad.ts), so the
// ambient sounds have to be played here or the app is silent.
//
// Files are Steam's: the backend serves them out of the local Steam install at
// /sounds/<name>.wav (see server.py). No Steam installed → 404 → silence, which
// is the intended graceful degradation, not a bug to fix.
